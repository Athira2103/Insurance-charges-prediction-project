**Insurance Claims Prediction Project**


The objective is to predict individual's insurance premium based on allocated features that are taken into consideration we also want to identify premium holders who pose a risk of making making claims agains their premiums in the near future.

**Project Goal**

To predict insurance charges based on given features.
 
**About The Dataset**

This data was scraped from Kaggle. Below are a list and definitions of them:

Charges: Total medical expense charged to the plan for the calendar year
Age: Insurance policyholder’s age, ranging from 18 to 64
Sex: Insurance policyholder’s gender identity- male or female
BMI: The Body Mass Index, used to vary premim costs
Children: Number of dependants/children on parents' insurance plan
Smoker: Smoking status of an insurance policyholder
Region: The beneficiary’s regional residential area within the US:Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, Southwest

**Method**

Step 1- Data collection: This will involve scapping of structured datafrom Kaggle.
Step 2- Data Preprocessing: In this phase, the data is prepared for the analysis purpose which contains relevant information. Pre-processing and cleaning of data are one of the most important tasks that must be one before dataset can be used for machine learning. The real-world data is noisy, incomplete and inconsistent. So, it is required to be cleaned.
Step 3- Extraction of Feature Set/Training Data: Feature set or training data can be prepared from the cleaned data by using any of the available techniques. The feature sets and training set that has obtained by using any method will be used for the implementation of machine learning algorithms.
Step 4- Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithm on Feature Set/Training Data:
Step 5: Testing of Data: Testing of data is done based on training model which is classified using supervised learning algorithm.

**Software tools & Hardware Requirements**
